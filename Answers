1) mkdir -p /home/user/tree/fruit  consider tree as parent directory and fruit as child directory 
2)Offline install of a package can be done in various ways. first we should have downloaded package in offline then install that with package management tools like dpkg or yum.
3) Through SSH Authentication we can access from one srever to another. 
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
cp authorized_keys authorized_keys_Backup
ssh <username>@<host>
4)ps-A show all the running process with process ID
5)find /path/directory -type f -mtime +x -exec rm
6)
Docker
1)Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers, which can then be easily deployed and scaled on any platform. This makes it easier for teams to build, test, and deploy applications consistently across different environments.
2)# Base image
   FROM python:3.9-slim
  # Working directory 
   WORKDIR /app
  # Copy Custom image to container 
   COPY requirements.txt
  # Install and Run all dependencies 
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir-r requirements.txt
  # Expose to port
   EXPOSE 5000
# app.py - a minimal flask api using flask_restful
from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Resource, Api
app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)
class HelloWorld(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return {'hello': 'world'}
api.add_resource(HelloWorld, '/')
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
3)The Docker lifecycle refers to the various stages a Docker container goes through from its creation to its deletion.stages are as follows Creation, Running, Stop, Restart ,Paused, Unpaused, Remove container.
4)Docker Image is an executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. This image informs how a container should instantiate, determining which software components will run and how. Docker Container is a virtual environment that bundles application code with all the dependencies required to run the application. The application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
5)Docker logs held in /var/lib/docker/container syntax- sudo docker logs <container>
Kubernets 
1)The services available in Kubernets are a) Cluster IP b) Nodeport c)Load Balancer d) Ingress 
2)The basic scheduling unit in Kubernetes is a Pod. A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in the Kubernetes ecosystem, representing one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other using localhost.
3)apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: new-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: new-container
    image: postgres:latest
    restartPolicy: Always
4)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
