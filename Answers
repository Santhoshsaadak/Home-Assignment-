1) mkdir -p /home/user/tree/fruit  consider tree as parent directory and fruit as child directory 
2)
3) Through SSH Authentication we can access from one srever to another. 
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
cp authorized_keys authorized_keys_Backup
ssh <username>@<host>
4)ps-A show all the running process with process ID

Docker
1)Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers, which can then be easily deployed and scaled on any platform. This makes it easier for teams to build, test, and deploy applications consistently across different environments.
2)# Base image
   FROM python:latest
  # Working directory 
   WORKDIR /app
  # Copy Custom image to container 
   COPY app.py /app
  # Install and Run all dependencies 
  RUN apt-get install -y python
  # Expose to port
   EXPOSE 80

4)Docker Image is an executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. This image informs how a container should instantiate, determining which software components will run and how. Docker Container is a virtual environment that bundles application code with all the dependencies required to run the application. The application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
5)Docker logs held in /var/lib/docker/container syntax- sudo docker logs <container>
Kubernets 
1)The services available in Kubernets are a) Cluster IP b) Nodeport c)Load Balancer d) Ingress 
2)The basic scheduling unit in Kubernetes is a Pod. A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in the Kubernetes ecosystem, representing one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other using localhost.
3)apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: new-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: new-container
    image: postgres:latest
    restartPolicy: Always
